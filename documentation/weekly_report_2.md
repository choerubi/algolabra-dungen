# Weekly Report #2

This week, I spent a total of **12** hours on the project. The week was busier than usual, and I only had the weekend to work on the project, so most of the commits were made on Saturday night or Sunday morning. Instead of using colored blocks as floor tiles, I wanted to find some free-to-use assets online. Although I am aware that the visual appearance is not the main focus of the project, I still want to make the project visually appealing, and I had wanted a chance to use my own chosen assets since I did not get the chance to do that in my previous pygame project in *Ohjelmoinnin jatkokurssi*. To my surprise, assets often do not come separated into individual sprites, but instead as spritesheets, or "tilesets", so I had to learn how to split the dungeon tileset I found into individual sprites. Luckily, I discovered [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/), which, after just a few minutes of confusion, let me do this in just a few clicks, so it did not end up being as big a problem as I initially thought.

I now have a working first version of the room generation. I still plan to add some features, such as *Generate* and *Exit* buttons and an option for user input, but I can now start working on the Bowyer-Watson algorithm. I had hoped to get started with it this week as well, but it had been two years since I last touched pygame, so it took me more time than I would have liked to get comfortable with the basics. Similarly, I remembered very little about how unit tests are constructed, so I had to spend some time studying that, as well.

Currently, testing beyond unit tests, and what kinds of more advanced tests are suitable for my project, is still unclear to me. However, I hope my confusion will clear up as I do some hands-on coding with the algorithms. If not, I will be in contact with the course instructor.
