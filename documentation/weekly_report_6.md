# Weekly Report #6

This week, I spent a total of **17** hours on the project. After fixing the problem with Prim's algorithm, I added extra edges to introduce cycles to the dungeon, and I fixed an issue with installing the project that came up in the first peer reviews. I am currently working on the A* algorithm. After that, I will start writing the remaining unit tests. Then, as the last step, I will add user input.
