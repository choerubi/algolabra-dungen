# Weekly Report #3

This week, I spent a total of **13** hours on the project. I worked on refactoring the code in `game_loop.py`, as the constructor of the `GameLoop` class was becoming a bit messy and handling more responsibilities than it should, so I wanted to address it before expanding the functionality further. I also went back to add some tweaks to room generation and its unit tests. Also, I accidentally made a complete mess out of my remote repository. While trying to remove a commit I was not satisfied with, I reset the head to the wrong commit and accidentally deleted some older commits from GitHub. I wasted a lot of time cherry-picking them back, but at least I now know better for the future.

I started working on the Bowyer-Watson algorithm, which, at first, seemed very confusing and overwhelming, but the steps for implementing it are becoming clearer as I continue working on it. Next week, I plan to finish the algorithm and its unit tests, and then start looking at some other test types that are fitting for my project. After that, I will start working on creating the MST using Prim's algorithm, but I am not sure if I will be able to start that next week, as the Bowyer-Watson algorithm still requires a significant amount of my time, but I will do my best to stay on schedule. Currently, I do not have anything that I need help with.
