# Weekly Report #1

This week I spent a total of 10 hours on the project. I spent the most time studying the algorithms used in the project, as Bowyer-Watson is completely new to me, and I have largely forgotten the algorithms covered in *Data Structures and Algorithms*. Next, I will start implementing the first step of dungeon generation, i.e. generating the rooms, and hopefully I will get to Bowyer-Watson next week as well. 

## Hours Spent

- Mon 27.10. - 2h - Exploring potential topics and reading the course instructions, choosing a topic, studying the topic and the algorithms.
- Tue 28.10. - 3h - Getting familiar with the algorithms, planning and illustrating the different stages of the project, planning the "framework" of the project.
- Thu 30.10. - 1h - Planning the different stages of the project, exploring some example projects.
- Fri 31.10. - 1h - Creating the repository and registering in Labtool.
