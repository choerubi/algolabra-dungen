# Weekly Report #4

This week, I spent a total of **14** hours on the project. Honestly, I do not have much to comment on this week. I finished the Bowyer-Watson algorithm, which took a lot of time, but went without any major problems. I am currently in the process of writing unit tests for it. For the other test types, I am considering integration testing, invariant testing, or some form of testing that introduces randomness to the test variables, such as property testing, but I am still a bit unsure about which approach would be the most appropriate. I am also not certain how many different test types are needed to ensure comprehensive test coverage. I hope to get some input on this during the lecture on testing. Next, after finishing the unit tests, I will start working on creating the MST using Prim's algorithm.
