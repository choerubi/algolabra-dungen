# Weekly Report #5

This week, I spent a total of **15** hours on the project. I am currently working on Prim's algorithm. My implementation is almost correct, but on some sets of rooms, it creates cycles in the MST, and I have been struggling to get it to work as intended, so I have not pushed it to the remote repository yet. After finishing Prim's algorithm, I will start working on adding extra edges to introduce cycles to the dungeon.
